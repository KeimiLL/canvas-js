# Multi-user paint

This is a collaborative drawing application that allows multiple users to draw on the same canvas in real-time. The application uses HTML canvas, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX and PHP to create beautiful and interactive animations.

<img src="images/ss3.png" alt="ss3" width="40%"/>



## Installation
To use the application, simply clone the repository and in browser use the localhost URL and the name of the folder like this: localhost/canvas-js/index.php. If you have a web server, the application should start. If not - you can download the XAMPP package from https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html.

## Usage
Once you have the application running, you can create a new canvas or join an existing one. Multiple users can then draw on the canvas simultaneously, with each user's changes being immediately reflected on all other users' screens.
